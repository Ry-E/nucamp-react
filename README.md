# React Front-End
<a href="http://3.133.161.173/home">Live Project Site<a/>
  
  This repo contains the front-end code for my Nucampsite project built with React. The site is a test project based around a fictional campsite website. It is a SPA with functionality for user authentication, commenting, saving favorites, and contacting the company.
